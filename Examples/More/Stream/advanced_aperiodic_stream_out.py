"""
Demonstrates setting up stream-in with stream-out that continuously updates.

Note: the LJM aperiodic stream-out functions are recommended for
    most use cases that require aperiodic stream-out

Streams in while streaming out arbitrary values. These arbitrary stream-out
values act on DAC0 to alternate between increasing the voltage from 0 to 2.5 and
decreasing from 5.0 to 2.5 on (approximately). Though these values are initially
generated during the call to createOutContext, the values could be
dynamically generated, read from a file, etc. To convert this example file into
a program to suit your needs, the primary things you need to do are:

    1. Edit the global setup variables in this file
    2. Define your own createOutContext function or equivalent
    3. Define your own processStreamResults function or equivalent

You may also need to configure AIN, etc.

Note:
    Our Python interfaces throw exceptions when there are any issues with
    device communications that need addressed. Many of our examples will
    terminate immediately when an exception is thrown. The onus is on the API
    user to address the cause of any exceptions thrown, and add exception
    handling when appropriate. We create our own exception classes that are
    derived from the built-in Python Exception class and can be caught as such.
    For more information, see the implementation in our source code and the
    Python standard documentation.
