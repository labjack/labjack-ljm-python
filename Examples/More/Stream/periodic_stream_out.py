"""
Demonstrates usage of the periodic stream-out functions.

Streams out arbitrary values. These arbitrary values act on DAC0 to cyclically
increase the voltage from 0 to 2.5.

Note:
    Our Python interfaces throw exceptions when there are any issues with
    device communications that need addressed. Many of our examples will
    terminate immediately when an exception is thrown. The onus is on the API
    user to address the cause of any exceptions thrown, and add exception
    handling when appropriate. We create our own exception classes that are
    derived from the built-in Python Exception class and can be caught as such.
    For more information, see the implementation in our source code and the
    Python standard documentation.
